                              PHP CODEPAD


*WARNING:* This is a tool designed only for local development! Using it
on any server connected to the internet is a HUGE security threat.


About:

    The codepad executes the entered text as PHP code. It's use is to
    provide a fast way to experiment with PHP, similar to a shell or
    command line in other languages. There is no safety net. If your web
    server is allowed to ruin your system, then commands entered in the
    pad might just as well do so.

    The pad features an SQLite based history of commands.


Installation:

    Copy pad.php to the docroot (or another location reachable by your
    local development webserver). Touch pad.sqlite in the same directory
    and give the webserver write access to it. This file serves as
    command history database.

    Open localhost/pad.php in your browser. Again, make triple-sure,
    that it cannot be reached from anyone outside.

    Done. Enjoy fast PHP prototyping.
