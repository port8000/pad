                              PHP CODEPAD


*WARNING:* This is a tool designed only for local development! Using it
on any server connected to the internet is a HUGE security threat.

The codepad executes the entered text as PHP code. It's use is to
provide a fast way to experiment with PHP, similar to a shell or command
line in other languages. There is no safety net. If your web server is
allowed to ruin your system, then commands entered in the pad might just
as well do so.

The pad features an SQLite based history of commands.


Installation:

Copy pad.php and pad.css to the docroot (or another location reachable
by your local development webserver). Touch pad.sqlite in the same
directory and give the webserver write access to it. This file serves as
command history database.

Open localhost/pad.php in your browser. Again, make triple-sure, that it
cannot be reached from anyone outside.
